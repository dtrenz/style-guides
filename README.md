#About

This is a central repository of idiomatic coding style guides for HTML, CSS, JS, &amp; PHP.  Most of these docs are taken from existing style guides, most notably;

* [necolas / idiomatic-css](https://github.com/necolas/idiomatic-css)
* [rwldrn / idiomatic.js](https://github.com/rwldrn/idiomatic.js/)
* [php-fig / fig-standards](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards)


##Why Not Simply Fork Existing Guides?

A few reasons - while these guides make for a great foundation;

1. They leave some areas up for interpretation, which - if left undefined - could undermine consistency.
2. We didn't agree with 100% of the recommendations in these guides.
3. It's just nice to have them all in one location.
